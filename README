To convert an existing ClientProject to use an XCode 4 Workspace with Desiccant as a subproject:

1)  Remove any references to existing Desiccant from ClientProject

2)  In XCode: Create ClientProject XCode workspace in ClientProject root.  ClientProject should be located somewhere inside this workspace root.

3)  From Finder, drag ClientProject.xcodeproj into XCode workspace navigator.

4)  To Add Desiccant:

From workspace root:

git clone git@github.com:czgarrett/desiccant.git
cd desiccant

If branch doesn't exist:
git checkout -b client_project_branch_name
git push origin client_project_branch_name

If branch exists:
git fetch
git checkout -b client_project_branch_name origin/client_project_branch_name

To allow non-devs to check out easily:

cp desiccant/update_libraries.rb .
mate update_libraries.rb

Edit update_libraries with your desiccant branch name

Drag the desiccant/Desiccant.xcodeproj file from the finder into the workspace navigator.  Be sure not to drag it into the existing project, but below it.

Select ClientProject in XCode:

Add ../desiccant/desiccant/Classes/** to Header Search Paths

Add -ObjC and -all_load to "Other Linker Flags"

Drag desiccant/Products/libdesiccant.a to the Frameworks section of ClientProject

Add frameworks used by Desiccant to your own project by dragging frameworks from the desiccant project into your client project's frameworks group.
