- Changed DTLog to print without timestamp line noise, with lines separated by "--"
- Changed "(self = [super init])" idiom to "((self = [super init]))" to silence warnings.
- Changed DTPlayMediaLinkController to use MPMoviePlayerViewController instead of a UIWebView, as iOS 4.3 seems to have broken our existing UIWebView based implementation.
- Changed DTSpinner implementation to maintain its reference count in its own global variable rather than directly incrementing/decrementing [UIApplication sharedApplication].networkActivityIndicatorVisible.  This change was necessary because the latest builds of ASIHTTPRequest and three20 have started setting networkActivityIndicatorVisible themselves, which broke our reference counts leading to infinite spinners.
- -[NSMutableData nullTerminated] now makes a copy of the data and null terminates that copy (via -[NSData nullTerminated] rather than null terminating itself in-place.  Needed this because null terminating an NSMutableData for the sake of a diagnostic NSLog caused XML parsing to break on the null terminator as a side effect.
- Added -[NSMutableData terminateWithNull] to null terminate an NSMutableData in place without copying.
- Added -setDate:forKey: and -dateForKey: to NSUserDefaults+Zest.

- Updated ASIHTTPRequest
- -[DTKeychain persistKeyPath:ofObject:defaultValue:] uses KVO to persist the specified string property of the specified object.
- DTHTTPQuery and its subclasses now support HTTP basic auth via username and password properties.
- DTJSONQuery can now post the file at postFilePath.
- -[NSData to_s] tries decoding its data as UTF-8.  If that fails, it tries decoding as ISOLatin1.
- -[NSString to_n/to_i/to_double] can now handle numbers with commas.
- +[UIApplication versionNumberString] returns the version number from info.plist.
- +[UIApplication bundleName] returns the app bundle name from info.plist.
- +[UIApplication buildNumberString] returns a string that uniquely identifies the build with a unique, monotonically increasing, non-sequential integer, based on seconds since a given date.
- DTGaugeView presents a radial gauge like a speedometer.  Currently hard-coded to use NeedleImage.png for the rotating needle and PinImage.png for the pin on top of the needle.
- Zest extensions to UIScrollView: -currentHorizontalPage and -currentVerticalPage, based on contentOffset.

- DTDataDrivenTableViewController new methods: hasNoResultsCell, heightForNoResultsCell, and new property: noResultsCell.  If the query returns no results, and hasNoResultsCell returns YES, it displays the noResultsCell with the height returned by heightForNoResultsCell.  If you use the setter to set noResultsCell to something non-nil, hasNoResultsCell will return YES by default, and heightForNoResultsCell will return the height of the cell object you passed.

- -[DTDataDrivenTableViewController setNoResultsCellWithMessage:] is a convenient way to define a noResultsCell for a DTDDTVC by passing just a string.

- Cleared up some possible EXC_BAD_ACCESS bugs by setting some delegates to nil in some deallocs.d

- -[DTDataDrivenTableViewController viewDidDisappear] now cancels an executing query if you navigate away.  This makes the UI more responsive.

- DTMapViewController now works around an Apple bug in MapKit that causes an EXC_BAD_ACCESS if the view gets dealloced before an annotation animation completes.  See http://omegadelta.net/2009/11/02/mkdotbounceanimation-animationdidstop-bug/.

- DTPlayMediaLinkController now displays an activity indicator during the delay between the time when a user clicks on a media item and the time when the media player gets displayed.

- -[DTWebViewController removeAllLinkControllers]

- Fixed a bug in DTWebViewController that could result in an infinite spinner in the status bar if you backed out of DTWebViewController while the page is loading.

- New External SDURLCache behaves like NSURLCache, except it actually caches to disk, which NSURLCache doesn't on iPhone.

- DTCustomTableViewCell now really does enforce the initial height of a cell when as the minimum height that the cell can ever assume as a result of resizing via adjustHeightForLabel:.

- Removed some extraneous diagnostic NSLogs.

- Zest: -[NSUserDefaults persistKeyPath:ofObject:defaultValue:] automatically persists specified object properties across executions, with a few limitations.  It uses KVO to monitor changes to the specified keyPath and persist them.  Loads the keyPath with the persisted value if one exists, or else the specified defaultValue.  Warning: The value is persisted using a key constructed by concatenating the object's class name with the specified keyPath.  So if you pass two instances of the same class to this method with the same keyPath, the last setter called will dictate the persisted value for all instances.  Also note that NSUserDefaults has certain restrictions about which objects it can persist.  Those restrictions apply to this method as well.

- Zest: -[NSString unlessEmpty] returns nil if the string's length is zero, self otherwise.

- Zest: -[NSURL urlForDrivingDirectionsFrom:forceTitle:to:forceTitle:] returns a Google driving directions URL.

- Zest: -[MKMapView nonUserLocationAnnotations] returns all of the map's annotations except the MKUserLocation.

- Implemented DTLog() function, which has the same signature os NSLog, but gets automatically disabled for production builds.  The output's also a bit different at the moment.  It outputs a timestamp with the target and selector on one line, and then the log output on the next line.  I'm not wedded to that format though.

- Replaced all NSLog calls in Desiccant with DTLog calls.

- Added -topContainerViewController property to DTViewController and DTTableViewController.  For controllers that participate in a nested viewController hierarchy (via DTCompositeViewController, for example) this returns the top controller in the controller's view hierarchy.  Returns self if the controller doesn't have a container.

- Fixed a bug in DTViewController/DTTableViewController that led to an infinite mutual recursion loop with DTAdViewController on shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:

- DTAdViewController subclasses can now optionally override -adDisplayDelayInterval and return some number of seconds that the controller should wait before displaying the ad.  Defaults to 0.

- Added DTDrivingDirectionsViewController, which presents "Directions To Here" and "Directions From Here" options for a map annotation.

- Changed DTMapViewController to present a DTDrivingDirectionsViewController by default on mapView:annotationView:calloutAccessoryControlTapped:

- Added -[DTStaticTableViewController dataDictionaryForRowAtIndexPath:]

- Added -[DTAddress mapAnnotationTitle], which presents the best one-liner description for an address.

- Changed DTHTTPQueryOperation to pass a filename and content type on upload.  Just realized I accidentally hard coded this to @"image.jpg" and @"image/jpeg", which is app specific.  I'll fix that to make it configurable as soon as I have a chance.

- DTSpinner now stops spinning and stays stopped even if you call -hide more times than you call -show.

- Fixed another weird layout bug in DTCustomTableViewCell for cells that contain multiple variable height labels.  I *think* it should enforce a minimum cell height again as a result, but need to do more testing on this.

- DTRSSCell now hides labels of zero length.

-	[DTAdViewController shouldAutoRotateToInterfaceOrientation] now delegates to its 
	child viewController by default.

-	Removed the code in -[DTCustomTableViewCell adjustHeightForLabel] that enforced
	the cell's initial height as a minimum height.  Once the minimum height is 
	enforced on a cell once, its margins become corrupted, causing indeterminate 
	layout issues upon cell reuse.  For now, just be aware that short and/or missing 
	text text may lead to short cells.
	
Changes committed Apr. 23, 2010 by Curtis Duhn:

-	Exposed parserError via DTXMLParser.

-	Fixed regression bug in DTHTTPQueryOperation where all queries were being  
	submitted as POST requests, regardless of the method specified.

Changes committed Apr. 21, 2010 by Curtis Duhn:

-	Added basic getting started instructions to README.

-	Created CHANGES file for tracking changes.

-	New Class: Controllers/DTAdViewController is a wrapper controller
	(i.e. a DTCompositeViewController) that loads and presents an ad underneath
	another sub-controller's view.  Works with or without a NIB.

	to show ads served via the OpenX XML-RPC API.
	
-	New Class: DTButton generates glossy buttons programmatically.

-	-[DTImageView loadFromURL:] now tries to load the image from the local
	cache before issuing a remote request.
	
-	Added BOOL warnBeforeExit property to ACAboutViewController.  Prompts user
	before exiting the app if YES.

-	Fixed DTCompositeViewController so that it accepts DTTableViewControllers as 
	children in addition to DTViewControllers.  It now takes anything that implements
	<DTActsAsChildViewController>.

-	New Property: -DTTableViewController.containerViewController.

-	New: -[DT(Table)ViewController viewWillFirstAppear]

-	New: -[DT(Table)ViewController viewDidFirstAppear]

-	New Property: -DT(Table)ViewController.hasAppeared

-	Added a check to make sure a controller can't be added twice using
 	-[DTCompositeViewController addSubviewController:].

-	-[DTCompositeViewController removeSubviewController:] now sets the 
	subviewController's containerViewController to nil.
	
-	DTDataDrivenTableViewController now supports hasDynamicHeight for tables with
	programmatically created cells in cases where cellNibName isn't set.
	
- 	Bug: DTDataDrivenTableViewController wasn't setting the height when cellNibName
	was defined, and hasDynamicHeight returned NO.

-	New Property: -DTTabBarController.windowOverlay

-	New Property: -DTTabBarController.activityIndicator

-	New: -[DTStaticTableViewController fadeWindowOverlay]

-	New: -[DTWebViewController webViewIsReadyForJavascript:] will get called if the
	webView tries to load app://loaded.  This is intended to be used in
	the document's onload to signal that the browser is ready to receive javascript.
	By default, it evaluates the contents of javascriptOnLoad if the property is
	defined. 
	
-	Added External/ASIHTTPRequest so that I could reuse its file posting
	implementation.

-	New class: DTKeychain, with simple wrapper methods for setting and getting 
	values for keys in the keychain.

-	Added External/SFHFKeychainUtils, used by DTKeychain.

-	DTHTTPQuery and its subclasses now support these properties for POST method 
	requests: postParameters, postFileKey, postFileData, postFilePath.

-	DTCustomTableViewCell now overrides the read-only textLabel, detailTextLabel,
	and imageView properties and makes them read-write IBOutlets.  This gives us
	the ability to customize the layout and presentation of these fields via a NIB.

-	DTCustomTableViewCell now supports a <DTCustomTableViewCellDelegate>, which 
	includes methods for deriving a cell's title, subtitle, and image from the data    
	property.
	
-	New Class: DTSetDataBasedTableViewController is now the superclass of 
	DTCustomTableViewController and DTStaticTableViewController.  It implements 
	default <DTCustomTableViewCellDelegate> methods for deriving a cell's title, 
	subtitle, and image based on specific data fields.  These methods can be 
	overridden by subclasses.
                                
-	<DTCustomTableViewCellDelegate> classes can implement -cellShouldResizeTitle: or   
	cellShouldResizeSubtitle: and return YES to give cells variable height based on 
	those fields.
	
-	DTCustomTableViewCell subclasses can manually adjust the height of their cells 
	in setData: if they also implement -hasDynamicHeight and return YES.

-	New Class: DTTitleAndImageCell

-	Zest: $A(obj1, obj2, ...) shorthand for -[NSArray arrayWithObjects:]

-	Zest: $MA(obj1, obj2, ...) shorthand for -[NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:]

-	Zest: $D(key1, value1, key2, value2, ...) shorthand for -[NSDictionary dictionaryWithKeysAndObjects].  (Note the key -> value ordering.)

-	Zest: $MD(key1, value1, key2, value2, ...) shorthand for -[NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithKeysAndObjects].  (Note the key -> value ordering.)

-	Zest: $S(formatString, param1, param2, ...) shorthand for -[NSString stringWithFormat:]

-	Zest: -[NSArray (mutable)arrayAtIndex]

-	Zest: -[NSArray perform:withObject:withObject]

-	Zest: -[NSDate stringWithDateFormat:]

-	Zest: +[NSDictionary dictionaryWithTitle:subtitle:] shortcut factory method.

-	Zest: -[NSDictionary boolForKey]

-	Zest: -[NSDictionary toQueryString] generates a query string for an HTTP URL.

-	Zest: -[NSDictionary dictionaryWithKeysAndObjects:...] supports the more 
	familiar key -> value ordering as an alternative to Obj C's silly value <- key
	ordering.

-	Zest: -[NSMutableURLRequest setPostParameters:] takes an NSDictionary

-	Zest: -[NSString contains:]

-	Zest: -[NSString containsRegex:]

-	Zest: -[NSString stringByAddingPercentEscapesIncludingLegalCharactersUsingEncoding:] 
	escapes ALL characters necessary to pass a URL as a parameter within another 
	URL.  The normal stringByAddingPercentEscapesUsingEncoding doesn't escape some 
	characters that are legal in URLs like + for example.
	
-	Zest: -[UINavigationController popToViewControllerWithClass:animated:] now 
	returns an array of popped controllers.
	
-	Zest: -[UIScreen center] returns the center point of the screen.  (Not tested in 
	landscape mode.)
	
-	Zest: UIView now supports read-write width, height, x, and y properties for 
	inspecting and modifying the frame.
	
-	Zest: -UIView.cornerRadius

-	Zest: -UIView.borderWidth

-	Zest: -UIView.borderColor

-	Prefab cells can be copied and modified for quick cell design:
	-	Resources/Cells/DTCenteredTitleOnlyCell.xib
	-	Resources/Cells/DTTextEditorCell.xib implements a label and an editable 
		UITextField.
	-	Resources/Cells/DTTitleAndImageCell.xib
